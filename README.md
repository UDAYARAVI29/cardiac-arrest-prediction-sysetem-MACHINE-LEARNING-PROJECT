# cardiac-arrest-prediction-sysetem-MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT
A cardiac arrest detection system using machine learning and Python leverages advanced algorithms to analyze real-time physiological data and identify life-threatening conditions. By training models on vast datasets of heart rate variability, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, and other biomarkers, these systems can accurately predict and alert healthcare providers to potential cardiac arrest events. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries, such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, facilitates the development of these models, enabling efficient processing and accurate detection. This technology promises to enhance emergency response times and improve patient outcomes through early intervention.
